Ensure your AWS account has the proper permissions settings to install OpenShift via Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI).

For a list of required permissions, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html#installation-aws-permissions_installing-aws-account[Required AWS permissions^].

This Quick Start creates a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with the `AdministratorAccess` policy.

This Quick Start requires a Red Hat subscription. During the deployment of the Quick Start, provide your https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift Installer Provisioned Infrastructure pull secret^].

If you donâ€™t have a Red Hat account, you can register on the Red Hat website. Note that registration may require a non-personal email address. To get a 60-day evaluation license for OpenShift, see the instructions in https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform^].
