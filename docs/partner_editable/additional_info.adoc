== Create DNS record
Before you can test the deployment, add one DNS record to your hosted zone in Amazon Route 53:

. Go to Amazon Route 53 console.
. Choose the hosted zone that corresponds to the domain name that you specified as the `DomainName` parameter. . .. Choose *Create Record*.
. Pick the Simple routing policy, and then choose *Define simple record*, as shown in <<postDeploy1>>.
. Confirm that the record name matches the `CPSFQDN` parameter input that you passed when creating the stack.
. Confirm that the record type is CNAME.
. For the value of the record, specify `cp-console.apps.ClusterName.DomainName`, where `ClusterName` and `DomainName` were passed as input parameters.

== Test the deployment

. After you have completed the link:#_create_dns_record[create DNS record step] above, navigate to the *CP4SWebClientURL* output of the root stack, as shown in <<cfn_outputs>>.
. A new tab opens in your browser. You see either the {partner-product-short-name} web client login page or a warning from your browser that the HTTPS connection is not safe. By default, the public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate that is created for the {partner-product-short-name} cluster is self-signed, which causes the unsafe connection warning from your browser.
. Log in to the {partner-product-short-name} web client by choosing *Default authentication*, and then entering the default user `platform-admin` and the admin password that you supplied when creating the stack. If you did not supply a password, you can retrieve it from the *CP4SSecret* secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
. After you log in, the welcome page opens, as shown in <<testStep1>>.

== Post deployment steps

Before using {partner-product-short-name}, define users and connect the platform to data sources in your environment, following the instructions in the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTDPP_1.1.0/docs/security-pak/postinstallation.html[IBM Knowledge Center^].

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

{partner-product-name} connects to various data sources using data connectors. Ensure that only trusted priveleged users have access to both the data sources on the {partner-product-short-name} console or the OpenShift console.

== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

{partner-product-name} has a simple static LDAP-configured (openLDAP and phpLDAPadmin) user system. Connect your own LDAP server to IBM Common Services to better support your long-term use of the product. For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSTDPP_1.4.0/platform/docs/security-pak/ldap-connect.html[Configuration LDAP authentication^].
